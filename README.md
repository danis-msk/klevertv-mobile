## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Launches the application in development mode on android

### `npm start-browser`

Launches the application in development mode on browser - for development

### `npm build-android`

Builds the production app into the android build folder

### `npm build-browser`

Builds the production app into the browser build folder - for development

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run lint`

starts ESLint
